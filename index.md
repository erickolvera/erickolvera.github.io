I am an assitant professor in the [Hydrological Engineering group](https://cbi.izt.uam.mx/coddaa/index.php/ih-pemc) at the [Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana-Iztapalapa (UAM-I)](http://www.iztapalapa.uam.mx/). Before, I a worked as a posdoctoral researcher at the [Instituto de Ciencias de la Atmósfera y Cambio Climático, UNAM (ICAyCC)](https://www.atmosfera.unam.mx/) in the [Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction group](http://grupo-ioa.atmosfera.unam.mx/) under the supervision of Dr. Rosario Romero Centeno and Dr. Jorge Zavala Hidalgo, studying the dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico using numerical modeling. I did my Ph.D. in the [Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Eric Chassignet](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/eric-chassignet) at Florida State University. I received a masters degree in earth sciences from the ICAyCC, UNAM and an undergraduate degree in hydrological engineering from the UAM-I both in Mexico.
