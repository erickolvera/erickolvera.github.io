I am a posdoctoral researcher at [Instituto de Ciencias de la Atmósfera y Cambio Climático, UNAM](https://www.atmosfera.unam.mx/) in the [Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction group](http://grupo-ioa.atmosfera.unam.mx/). Before, I did my Ph.D. at the [Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Eric Chassignet](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/eric-chassignet) at the [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/).


I am a physical oceanographer interested in the interactions between ocean and atmospheric flows and topography. In particular, I use numerical models and laboratory scale models to investigate the role that topography plays in facilitating cross-shelf exchanges of water, nutrients, carbon and dissolved gases.
