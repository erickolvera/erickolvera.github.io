I am a posdoctoral researcher at the [Instituto de Ciencias de la Atmósfera y Cambio Climático, UNAM (ICACC)](https://www.atmosfera.unam.mx/) in the [Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction group](http://grupo-ioa.atmosfera.unam.mx/) studying the dynamics of the Gulf of Mexico using numerical modeling. Before, I did my Ph.D. at the [Center for Ocean-Atmospheric Prediction Studies](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/) under the supervision of Professor [Eric Chassignet](https://www.coaps.fsu.edu/eric-chassignet) at the [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/). I receive a masters degree in earth sciences from the ICACC, UNAM and an undergraduate degree in hydrological engineering from the [Autonomous Metropolitan University](http://www.iztapalapa.uam.mx/) both in Mexico.
